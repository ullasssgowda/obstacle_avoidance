# obstacle_avoidance
The Obstacle Avoidance Bot is a small robot powered by ESP32 and L298N, featuring 4 motors for enhanced mobility. It uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles within 10 cm. Upon detecting an obstacle, the bot reverses or stops to avoid collisions, and continues forward when clear.
